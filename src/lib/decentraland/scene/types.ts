 * The scenes in any renderer implementing the Decentraland Protocol are controlled
 * by the scripting host (the JS vm). Each host should run its own (game) loop,
 * and call the .onUpdate function of the scene, its result is a promise, because
 * as part of the onUpdate, the scene code sends all the CRDT updates to the renderer
 * and awaits its response. The response may be delayed a couple of "rendering frames",
 * generating the need of asynchronous code.
 * 
 * The EngineApiInterface exposes the two functions required by the scene via
 *   require("~system/EngineApi")
 * to articulate the previously described behaviors. To gain more details about
 * the semantics of the messages, refer to
 * 
 * @ADR https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-133 - Scene runtime definition
